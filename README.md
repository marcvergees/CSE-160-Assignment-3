# Assignment 3: Blocky World Contest

**Course**: CSE 160: Introduction to Computer Graphics, UCSC
**Term**: Winter 2026
**Author**: Marc Verges
**Email**: mvergess@ucsc.edu

## 🏰 Project Description

Welcome to my **Blocky World**, a custom-built WebGL environment featuring a medieval castle theme. This project demonstrates 3D rendering, user interaction, texturing, and performance optimization techniques learned in CSE 160. Explore the castle, interact with the specialized mechanisms, and enjoy the immersive medieval atmosphere.

### 🌟 Key Features

*   **Immersive Medieval World**: A castle environment built with varied block types and textures including stone, wood, trees, diamond blocks, chests, TNT, and terrain.
*   **First-Person Navigation**: Move freely through the world using standard WASD controls and mouse look.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes `renderfast()` for efficient rendering of the large block-based map and scene.
*   **Dynamic UI**: A custom-styled medieval user interface with controls for camera perspective, gate mechanisms, and debug visualization.

## 🎮 Controls

### Movement
*   **W**: Move Forward
*   **S**: Move Backward
*   **A**: Strafe Left
*   **D**: Move Right

### Camera / Look
*   **Mouse Drag**: Rotate Camera View (Pan/Tilt)
*   **Q / Left Arrow**: Pan Left
*   **E / Right Arrow**: Pan Right
*   **Up Arrow**: Tilt Up
*   **Down Arrow**: Tilt Down

### Special Actions
*   **P**: Reset Camera Position

## 🛠️ User Interface

The on-screen control panel allows you to:
*   **Perspective (Camera)**: Adjust the camera angle manually.
*   **Show Guide Lines**: Toggle the rendering of the coordinate axis for debugging.

## 📝 Notes to Grader

The project fulfills the assignment requirements with a focus on creating a cohesive theme. The world map is designed to resemble a fortified structure with varied terrain. Textures are mapped appropriately to different block types to distinguish materials. Performance has been considered by minimizing draw calls where possible using optimized rendering functions.
